    <h1>All About Sean M.</h1>
    <h2>Quick AutoBio</h2>
        <p>A Seattle native, I was born at Swedish Hospital on Beacon Hill in 1989. I attended High School at John F. Kennedy Memorial from 2004-2008 where I excelled in Mathematics, Socializing, and Soccer. After some time in college I decided to take a new route and began working in the food service industry. While working at Husky I learned a plethoria of new skills and met the love of my life, Taylor. after dating for some time Taylor and I began renting together and lived in our quiet apartment in West Seattle until the fall of 2017, when a ravage bush fire destroyed our unit along with 5 others as well. In 2018 I began a new journey with my eyes set on coding in the tech world. That story has yet to unfold.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Much of my early education came from the Catholic school system. This is a great foundation, in my opinion, because the focus on human values and just being kind to others was rooted in me at a young age. Over time these values have really hellped me flourish into the honest person I believe I am today. 
        In Fall of 2008 I attended the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs where I accrued education in Mathematics, Engineering, and human studies (i.e. Philosophy, Psycology, and Men & Woman studies). I did not graduate from UCCS and in 2011 I left the school for a new horizon. In Spring of 2012 I attended Gonzaga University where again I continued to study Physics and Engineering. The life style as a transfer student in their junior year was not an easy task and after just 2 semesters I packed my bags at went back home. Although I attened both Highline and Seattle Central College, neither provided a place where I thrived in my studies and ultimately I dropped out of both schools.
        Currently I study coding languages at Code Fellows.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy a multitude of activities, some physically active and others not as much. I am an avid sports fan and play Fantasy Football every year (I am the reigning Champion for 2017-2018 season). I enjoy hiking with my fiance Taylor and our 2-year-old English Bulldog. I enjoy a pick-up game of soccer every now and then, how ever the work playing goalkeeper has done to my body really deters that from being a regular activity of mine. I am a huge tabletop gamer! I play a lot of Magic the Gathering, Catan (all versions), Hearthstone, beer pong (which is technically on a table), and virtually any game someone brings over to try out. </p>
